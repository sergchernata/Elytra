# Arc fork: staying in sync with upstream Ladybird

This branch (`arc`) adds an Arc-style UI on top of Ladybird's Qt frontend.
All Arc code lives in `UI/Qt/Arc/`. Upstream files are touched in only three lines,
each marked `fork-only`:

| File | Hook |
| --- | --- |
| `UI/Qt/CMakeLists.txt` | `include(Arc/Arc.cmake)` after the main `target_sources` block |
| `UI/Qt/main.cpp` | `#include <UI/Qt/Arc/ArcChrome.h>` |
| `UI/Qt/main.cpp` | `Ladybird::Arc::install();` just before the first `app->new_window(...)` |

Check the full list any time with:

```sh
git diff upstream/master --stat -- . ':!UI/Qt/Arc' ':!SYNCING.md'
```

## Updating

```sh
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master          # replays the arc commits on top of the latest upstream
./Meta/ladybird.py build --preset Release
./Meta/ladybird.py run --preset Release
```

### If the rebase conflicts

Conflicts can only happen at the three hooks above. Re-add the hook line in the
equivalent spot in the new upstream code, then `git add` the file and run `git rebase --continue`.

### If the build breaks after a rebase

Upstream renamed or reworked something the Arc code uses (for example a method on
`BrowserWindow`, `Tab`, `LocationEdit` or the web view). To fix it:

1. Find the commit that broke it: `git log upstream/master -S'<old name>' -- UI/Qt`
2. See how upstream updated its own Qt code in that commit (`git show <hash> -- UI/Qt`).
3. Make the same change in `UI/Qt/Arc/`.

`UI/Qt/Arc/CommandBar.cpp` copies one piece of upstream logic,
`Tab::location_edit_return_pressed()`. If that function changes upstream, mirror the change.

## Building on this Mac

An old Intel Homebrew in `/usr/local` has binaries that can't run on this machine
(for example `sha512sum`), which breaks the dependency bootstrap. Build with `/usr/local`
removed from `PATH`:

```sh
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:$(echo "$PATH" | tr ':' '\n' | grep -v '^/usr/local' | grep -v '^/opt/homebrew' | paste -sd: -)"
```

## Backing up to GitHub

Fork `LadybirdBrowser/ladybird` on GitHub, then:

```sh
git remote add origin git@github.com:<you>/ladybird.git
git push -u origin arc
# after each rebase:
git push --force-with-lease origin arc
```
